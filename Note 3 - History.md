# History

##### Astronomy is oldest natural science
600 BC - 100 AD: Reasoning from observations; Sky is 3D

Babylonions -> Greeks -> Arabs -> Europeans

##### Greeks: Sky is 3D
Explains phases of Moon & eclipses
Q: Shape of Earth? (Pythagoras & Aristotle)
Q: Size of the Earth compared to the Moon?

#### Aristarchus (310-230 BC)
Calculated distance ratio:

	(Earth-Sun) : (Earth-Moon)

Measured time, T, from third quarter to first quarter

	Q = (1/2) * (T / T_month) * 360 degree
	A = B / cosθ = 19B -> 390B

Calculated size ratio:

	(Sun) : (Moon)

	a/b = A/B
	a = (A/B) * b = 390b

#### Eratosthenes (276-196 BC)
Calculated absolute size of Earth

Measure:

	a ~ 1/50 full circle
	D ~ 5000 stadia

Calculate Earth's circumference:

	C = 50 * 5000
	= 250,000 stadia
	~ 46,000 km

#### Hipparchus (190-120 BC)
- invented trig
- measured position and brightness of 850 stars - high precision, valuable today
- celestial coordinate system, magnitude system
- estimated Moon's size and distance
- measured length of year (to within 6 minutes of correct value)
- first reliable eclipse predictions
- discovered precession of the equinoxes

#### Aristotle (384-322 BC)
Argued forcefully in favour of Earth-centered universe

#### Plato (428-348 BC)
Asserted all heavenly motions are:
- in perfect circles
- at constant speed

#### Central problem of Ancient Astronomy
- retrograde motion?
- changing brightness?

Answer to **geocentric model** -> Epicycles
Answer to **heliocentric model** -> Earth moves

#### Ptolemy (100-170 AD)
To improve the accuracy of the epicycle model, Ptolemy added:
- Eccentric (displace Earth from center of deferent circle)
- Equant (constant angular speed seen from equant point)
	- but varying physical speed along deferent (sacrilege)
- Compiled all existing knowledge plus own innovations into Almagest, which was sufficiently accurate to dominate astro for 1500 years
- Eventually overthrown by Copernicus/Kepler/Galileo/Newton

#### Astro and Science
Area of study science
- observations of nature, record keeping
- classification of properties
- simple theories
- communication of results, ideas, models
- predictive powers
- testing of predictions and discarding ideas that fail

#### Copernicus (1473-1543)
- Heliocentric model
	- simpler more accurate
	- combine Ptolemy & Aristarchus
- Last of the Ancients
	- Wanted to remove Ptolemy's sacrilegious equant (non uniform circular motion)
	- the motion of heavenly bodies is uniform, eternal and circular or compounded of circular motions

#### Copernican vs Ptolemaic Model
- both have eccentric (center of deferent circle is displace from Sun/Earth)
- Copernican model avoids sacrilegious equant but make up with an epicycle
- Copernican model is less accurate than Ptolemaic model
- Both models require epicycles on epicycles for improved accuracy
- 34 circles suffice to explain entire structure of universe - Copernicus

### Summary
- Copernican model:
	- not less complicated than Ptolemy's model
	- not more accurate than Ptolemy's model
	Therefore, evidence for Earth's motion is not string
- Required
	- Earth not at center of universe
	- Earth revolving and spinning
	Both have physical and philosophical problems
- Copernicus began revolution but required Kepler, Galileo and Newton to complete

#### One good thing about Copernican Model
- In Ptolemaic model, angular data measured form Earth cannot determine the orbital radii of the planets (radii of deferent circles)
- can determine only the ratio of radii: epicycle to deferent
-**Key advantage** of Copernican model is that it breaks this scale invariance. Angular data alone can determine:
	- planets orbital radii relative to Earth's orbital radius (1 AU)
	- the correct order of the planets

Inferior Planet: Measure alpha at greatest elongation. Calculate distance form Sun to planet

	d(AU) = (1 AU) * sin(alpha)

Superior Planet: Measure time from opposition to quadrature. Based on previously measured sidereal periods of E and P, calculate

	alpha = ESE' - PSP'
	d(AU) = (1 AU) / cos(alpha)

- Copernicus was able to construct first qualitatively correct model of the Solar system.

#### Tycho Brahe (1546-1601)
- Used large carefully built instruments of own design -> most accurate naked eye date in human history
- Measured parallax of comet in 1577 -> Comet was farther from Earth than Moon
	- smashed ancient idea of crystalline celestial spheres
- Measured no parallax of stars to one arcminute
	- Implied distance to stars > 1000 AU
	- A central Earth is more believable than stars that far away?
- invented own hybrid geocentric model

#### Johannes Kepler (1571-1630)
- Gifted mathematician & astronomer
- Deeply religious. Believed:
	- God made the universe according to a mathematical plan, which He had called him to discover and reveal
	- Copernican model: Sun=Father, Stars=Son, Rest=Holy Spirit
- Kepler's first big discovery
	- for each Platonic solid, inscribe and circumscribe it with spheres, getting a shell with thickness proportional to radius
	- nest of five shells in proper order and out pops correct relative radii of all planets
- 1596: Mysterium Cosmographicum
	- Cosmic Mystery, which contains the secret of the universe.
	- on the Marvelous Proportion of the celestial spheres, and on the true and particular causes of the number, magnitude and periodic motions of the heavens
	- established by means of the five regular geometric solids

	- caught Tycho Brahe's eye, took Kepler as student

##### Physics Kepler knew:
- Aristotle:
	- v proportional to F
	- motion caused by consciousness (soul, intelligence, instinct)
	- consciousness of heavenly bodies is serene, causing simple uniform circular motion (regular motion that can go indefinitely)
- William Gilbert:
	- Theory of magnetic soul of Earth
	- Magnetism together with consciousness causes planetary motion
- Archimedes:
	- finding areas under curves using limits of inscribed and circumscribed polygons (inspired his nested Platonic solids)
- Nicholas of Cusa
	- Equivalence in the limit, of the straight line agnd circle of infinite radius or the infinitesimal arc and its chord

##### Kepler's Goals:
- Perfect accuracy in reproducing observations
- unified model based on physical causes

##### Kepler's War with Mars
- Vicarious Hypothesis
	- Tried non-equal eccentric and equant: f != g
	- Gave longitudes that fit Tycho's data within 2' error
	- but wrong latitude and distances

	- Tried equal eccentric and equant: f = g
	- Gave right distances
	- but wrong latitudes (8' error -> unacceptable)
- Completely overhauled Earth's orbit
	- All data observed from Earth, but Earth's orbit unknown
	- Unification: best agreement with data if all planets have equal eccentric and equant

but still used circles with eccentric and equant, not ellipse

- Kepler's distance law
	- noticed speed v inversely proportional to r at apsides
	- time to traverse equal arcs: change in t proportional to r
	- assumed (wrongly) v inversely proportional to r at all points on orbit
- Justification (using wrong physics)
	- Planets are driven around by rotating filaments emanating from rotating Sun, like spokes of a wheel
	- Magnetic life solar force spreads out in a plane -> diminishes as 1/r (vs 1/r^2)
	- Aristotle (wrong): v proportional to F proportional to 1/r
- Kepler's area law
	- v ∝ F ∝ 1/r => r dϑ/dt ∝ 1/r => dt ∝ r^2*dϑ => Δt ∝ ΔA
	- area law ~ distance law; Kepler used area law to simplify calculations, but still believed the distance law
	- computed longitudes of Marks using this area law (and circle + eccentric + equant); got errors as big as 8'
	- realized only one possibility left: orbit not circle
- Non-circular orbits
	- Kepler introduced an oval orbit, with epicycle driven by weird magentic mechanism
	- area law calculations with oval were too tedious so he replace oval with ellipse
	- area law and ellipse were not true; just approx to simplify calculations
	- after many iteration, Kepler finally realized the area law and ellipse were true

##### Kepler's work
- Kepler was a mystic, which helped obscure the genius of his science
- no doubt Kepler's discoveries were kinda of miracle of chance and love and also inventive hypothesizing and deductive logic - Curtis Wilson

#### Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion
1st - Ellipse Law:
Planets travel on elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus

2nd - Area Law:
A line drawn from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal area in equal time intervals

##### Properties of an ellipse
semimajor axis is the average distance of a body from the orbit's focus
an orbit's focus is at the location of the center of mass of the system

3rd Period Law:
The squares of the sidereal orbital periods of the planets are proportional to the cubes of the semimajor axis of their orbits.

	P^2 = a^3

For objects orbiting the Sun, P is in year and a is in AU.

#### Galileo (1563-1642)
- By experiment and reason he showed that the Earth could move.
- Made the first telescope observation:
	- mountains on Moon
	- Sunspots
	- Milky Way is made of stars
	- moons of Jupiter
	- phases of Venus
- solidified the Copernican revolution

- mountains & valleys on moon
- sunspots on sun
- imperfections challenged:
	- ideological separation between heavens and Earth
	- Need for perfect uniform circular motion of heavenly bodies

- milky way is mode of numerable very distant stars
- removed Tycho's parallax objection to Earth's motion:
	- if stars were much farther away, the lack of detectable parallax was no longer so troubling

- moons of jupiter
- undermined key rationale for geocentric model
	- if Jupiter is a cetner of motion, there must be multiple centers even in a geocentric model
	- thus, multiple centers in a heliocentric model is more palatable

- phases of venus
- perhaps most powerful blow against Ptolemaic geocentric model

## Summary of Revolution
- Copernicus
	- Revived heliocentric model (simplest explanation of retrograde motion)
	- First qualitatively correct model of Solar System (correct order and relative sizes of planetary orbits; still missing overall scale of Solar System)
- Kepler
	- High mathematical but work also filled mysticism and fanciful speculations
	- First to seriously attempt to bring physics into astronomy (astrophysics)
	- Three accurate laws (ellipse law, area law, period law) -> shift away from Creek circles
- Galileo
	- Brought incontrovertible observational evidence (moon of Jupiter, phases of Venus)
	- Argues persuasively against old Aristotelian physics (major obstacle to revolution)
	- Laid foundation for Newton's work
