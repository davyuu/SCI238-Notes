# Solar System 1

### Major Planets
- Mercury: 0.1 degree
- Venus: 177 degree
- Earth: 23 degree
- Mars: 25 degree
- Jupiter: 3 degree
- Saturn: 27 degree
- Uranus: 98 degree
- Neptune: 30 degree

#### Dwarf Planets
- Pluto: demoted from major planet to dwarf planet
- Ceres: largest object in asteroid belt
- Eris and moon Dysnomia

Dwarf planet:
	- Orbits Sun
	- Massive enough for its own gravity to crush itself into a hydrostatic equilibrium state (spheroid)
	- has not cleared its neighborhood of other material

- most planetary orbits are nearly circular
- all have same orbital direction
- most orbits are nearly coplanar
- axial tilts vary

#### Orbits
- Planetary orbits ~ coplanar (Mercury)
- Planets orbital plane ~ Sun's equatorial plane
- Orbital planes of most satellites near equatorial plane of their planets
- Rotational axes ~ perpendicular to orbital plane (Uranus)
- Orbital and rotation directions the same for planets and most satellites (Venus)

#### Physical Properties
- Inner SS: mainly heavier elements like metal and rock
- Outer SS: mainly lighter elements such as gas or ice
- Satellites generally share chemistry of their planets - but many variations

- Jupiter > all other combined (except Sun)

#### Terrestrial vs jovian (giant) Planets
- Terrestrial Planets
	- localed in inner part of Solar System
	- small
	- rock & metal (high density), with distinct surfaces
	- few moons
	- no rings
- Giant Planets
	- in out part of SS
	- large gaseous (low density)
	- many moons
	- rings
	- rapid rotation

### Earth
#### Prototype terrestrial planet
	- differentiated interior
		- outer core is fluid
		- inner core is solid
	- string magnetic field
	- active surface
		- volcanoes
		- continental plates
		- liquid water
	- atmosphere
		- N, O, minor amounts of other gases
		- greenhouse effect
	- radial structure:
		- inner core
		- outer core
		- mantle
		- crust

How heated:
	- Accretion: Grav pot energy converted to kinetic energy converted to thermal energy
	- Differentiation: Light materials right to surface and dense material fall to core, converting to thermal energy
	- Radioactive Decay: Mass-energy in nuclei converted to thermal energy
How cooled:
	- Convection: Hot rock rises and cooler rocks fall
	- Conduction: convection carries heat through rigit lithosphere to surface
	- Radiation: At surface, energy is radiatied to space
Heating vs Cooling
	- heating mechanisms ~ proportional to mass (and volume) ~ R^3
	- cooling ~ proportional to surface area ~ R^2
	- Q: given two planets of same comp and density, but diff radius, which cools faster

		Example: R_1 = 2R_2
			- heating: (Planet1 rate) ~ 8 x (Planet2 rate)
			- cooling: (Planet1 rate) ~ 4 * (Planet2 rate)
		=> larger bodies cool more slowly

#### Magnetic fields
Dynamically induced and maintained:
	- electrically conductive fluid (outer core)
	- Kinetic energy provided by planetary rotation
	- Internal energy (thermal) to drive convection

	∂B/∂t = η*▽^2 * B + ▽ x (u x B)
High above atmosphere Earth's magnetic field lines trap charged particels from the Sun (solar wind)
Solar wind distorts shape of the magnetosphere

	aurora: solar wind + magnetic field

#### Planetary Surfaces: Earth
- continental drift causes constant change to surface:
	- volcanoes, mountain building, faults
- erosion of surface (water, wind)
- meteorite impacts

Continental drift (motion of tectonic plates) is driven by convection in upper mantle, causing subduction and sea floor spreading

Tectonic plates: boundaries and motion

North America is result of:
	- subduction
	- collisions
	- volcanism
	- erosion
	- sedimentary deposits

tectonic forces and compress or stretch the crust and plates can slide along each other
When plates pull apart, crust thins and rift valleys form

Earthquakes occur mostly at plate boundaries

Africa and South America used to be together

#### Planetary Atmosphere - Overview
- Origin of planetary atmospheres: at formation? or later from outgassing?
- Loss of atmospheric gasses: temp (T), surface gravity of planet, mass of gas atom/molecule
- Vertical structure: pressure, temp
	- climate depends on heating & rotation of planet
- Horizontal structure (circulation): heating & rotation
- Greenhouse effect: surface heating, clouds
- CO_2 and other cyclse: weathering, precipitation, chemistry

#### Earth
- Atmosphere (secondary): original all/mostly lost
- Atmosphere comp: outgassing, CO_2 chemistry, life
- Surface T: combination of solar heating, IR radiation trapped by cloud layer
- Atmmospheric circulation and climate: depend on heating and rotation
- Earth's atmosphere is 78% N, 21% O, 0.9% Ar, 0.03% CO_2, 0.0018% Ne, 0.00052% He,
	- CO_2 increased by 10% in last 40 years (0.0315 -> 0.0355)

Earth is illuminated and heated by the Sun
	-> day/night temp variation depends on rotation speed

Atmosphere blocks some ƛ and transmits others

#### Atmospheres have structure
Exosphere:
	- heated by solar UV + Xray
	- region of greatest excape (high T, altitude)
Thermosphere + Ionosphere:
	- Xrays heat and ionize
Stratosphere:
	- heated by UV light
	- no convection
Troposphere:
	- topped by clouds
	- trapping of IR from surface
	- radiation, convection important

Atosphereic structure depends on: T, solar radiation, gravity
cloud layers (water vapor) important factor in trapping heat

#### Greenhouse Effect
Earth's atmosphere transparent to visible light (from the Sun), which heats the surface

Surface cools by emitting IR light

Earth's atmosphere not transparent to IR light: CO_2 absorption in IR ƛ

Atmosphere heats up in order to balance incoming heat from sunlight

Increasing the amount of atmosphereic CO_2 will increase T

Atmospheres lose mass by: escape, solar wind, impacts, condensation and chemical reactions

Gas temperature <=> partical velocity, thus probabilty of escape

	in early SS, T>> present => major atmos loss for terrestrial bodies

#### Escape of Atmos
- atmos gases can escape if tehy have low mass (H or He)
- since v_gas depends on sqrt(T/m_gas), higher T means escape more likely => higher mass gases can escape
- to retain a gas of mass m (amu) on a planet with mass M and radius R (in Earth units) the temperature T must be:

	T < 75K  m*M/R

#### CO_2 cycle => atmospheric CO_2 abundance
atmos -> ocean -> rocks -> atmos

atmos CO_2 low on Earth because most is bound up in crustal rocks

CO_2 cycle acts as thermostat for Earth through negative feedback
- when atmos T is cool, less precipitation => CO_2 increase
- when hot, more precip => CO_2 decrease

Historical correlation between CO_2 levels and avg temp shows

Atmos gain gas due to: outgassing, evaporation, impacts

##### Atmos heating:
- creates a circulation cell in each hemisphere
- warm air rises near equator and cools as it moves toward the poles
- cool air falls near poles and warms as it moves toward the equator

##### Earth's rotation
- affects atmos circulations trhough **Coriolis effect**
- in rotating frame, objects do not move in straight lines
- on rotating Earth, horizontally-moving air deviates to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and left in the Southern Hemisphere

##### Coriolis effect causes circulation:
- Low pressure regions draw in air from surroundings
- horizontally-moving air is deflected into circular flows (CCWise in North and CWise in South)

Causes circulation cells to divide:
- on Earth there are three cells per hemisphere
- gas giant planets also show cells, some have more or less than Earth

### Mercury
- least well observed of five
- surface is heavily cratered and has large impact feature
- shows cracks, ridges, scarps, evidence of lava flow
- relatively high density -> core is large and iron rich
- weak magnetic field is a puzzle

Long cliffs -> indications of cooling and shrinking

Magnetic Field
- Weak but stable
	- High eccentricity -> tidal heating -> liquid iron core
	- very slow rotation
- Interacts with Sun's magnetic field -> magnetic tornadoes

### Venus
- atmos: dense, hot (735K = 462 degree Celcius), 96.5% CO_2, sulphuric acid clouds - extreme Greenhouse effect
- at surface P_atm ~ 92 P_earth (~ 1 km under ocean)
- surface data mainly from orbiters with radio (radar) and IR detection, some landers
- no magnetic field -> maybe due to slow rotation
- few craters, even large ones => planet wide resurfacing ~ 10^9 years ago?
- surface has some continents, maybe active volcanoes
- little known about interior (no seismic data)
- sidereal day = 243 Earth days retrograde
- orbital period = 225 Earth days -> day longer than year

Venus cloud tops reflect more sunlight but greenhouse effect >> on Venus vs Earth

#### Venus vs Earth
Start with similar outgassing of CO_2 and H_2O

###### Earth:
starts slightly cooler

H_2O gas cools, condenses, falls as rain, makes oceans and evaporates again -> H_2O liquid/gas cycle

CO_2 dissolves in rain -> stored in rocks. Photosynthesis converts CO_2 to O_2.

Left with almost no CO_2, a little O_2, and H_2O in a cycle

###### Venus:
starts lightly warmer

Even if it started with ocneas: warmer -> more evaporation & air can hold more H_2O -> more H_2O greenhouse gas -> warmer => Positive feedback

Oceans evoporate, H2O photodissociates. H -> space; O -> chemically bound up

Left with lots of CO2, no H2O. -> Runaway greenhouse effect

### Mars
- two tiny moons
- very think atmos, 95.3% CO2
- at surface P_atm ~ 0.006 P_earth
- temp ~V 220K = -50 degree Celcius (-143 to 35 degree)
- very weak magnetic field
- surface:
	- N hemi. lower & much less cratered than S hemi
	- red from icon oxides
	- long canyons, flow featuers
	- volcanoes
	- polar caps frozen CO2; seasonal exchange with atm
- rotates in 24h 37m 22s

some rocks are cooled lava (igneous) and some are sedimentary (interaction with water)

Mars has long canyons that look very similar to long canyons on the Earth that are formed by water erosion

### Moon
- mass ~ 1/83 M_earth
- largest moon/planet ratio in SS
- virtually no atmos
- surface heavily created, esp on side away from Earth
- titally locked to Earth
- 10-20 times closer to Earth at formation

surface distinguished by: Maria (smooth, dark), highlands (cratered, bright)

Interior is differentiates but lithosphere is comparatively very thick

Craters on Moon are due to impact events -> impact process forms characteristic shape

Maria are huge impact basins that were flooded by lava. Only a few small craters appear.
Highlands are ancient and heavily cratered.

### Summary
All tertestrial bodies are differentiated => all had hot and fluid interiors at some time
Larger terrestrial planets:
	- cooled more slowly
	- more and longer lasting tectonic activity
	- easier to retain atmos
Planets closer to Sun:
	- higher T
	- harder to retain liquid water, atmospheres
higher rotation => more weather
fewer impact craters on massive planets
	- cooled more slowly
	- atmos sheild only against small impactors
