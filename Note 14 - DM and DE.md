# Dark Matter & Dark Energy

## Evidence for DM

### Galaxy Rotation

	v = sqrt( G*M_sun / r )

- Planets orbit Sun
- orbital speed drops off like 1/sqrt(r)

- stars and gas in spiral galaxy orbit galactic center like planets orbit sun
- can measure orbital speed using Doppler shift of stellar spectra
	- or 21-cm line of atomic hydrogen (even past stars in disk)
- assuming most of mass is in galactic bulge, expect orbital speed to drop off like 1/sqrt(r) outside bulge

A = Expected: v(r) ~ 1/sqrt(r)
B = Observed: v(r) ~= constant

	v(r) = sqrt( G * M(r) / r ) -> M(r) = v(r)^2 * r / G ~ r

Total mass enclosed in radius r increases wit r (!= constant)

- visible portion of galaxy lie deep in heart of large halo of dark matter
< 10% visible matter
> 90% dark matter

 ### Spectral Broadening
 - broadening of spectral lines in elliptical galaxies tells how fast stars orbiting at given radius
 - gaalxies have similar ratios of dark matter to visible matter

 ### Galaxy Velocities in Clusters
 - can measure velocities of galaxies in cluster from Doppler shifts
 - mass found from galaxy motions in cluster about 50 times larger than mass in stars

 ### Hot Gas in Clusters
 - clusters contain large amounts of Xray emitting hot gas
 - temp of hot gas (particle motions) tell us cluster mass:
	 - 85% dark matter
	 - 13% hot gas
	 - 2% stars

### Gravitational Lensing
- bending of light rays by gravity
	- can tell cluster's mass (stars + gas + dark matter)

## Summary
- many indep measrues of mass:
	- __Galaxy rotation__ curves in spiral galaxies
	- __Spectral broadening__ in elliptical galaxies
	- __Galaxy velocites__ in clusters of elliptical galaxies
	- __Gas particle velocities__ in clusters of elliptical galaxies
	- __Gravitational lensing__ of clusters of elliptical galaxies
- suggest that there is roughly 50 imtes as much dark matter as visible matter in stars

## What is Dark Matter
- __Ordinary Dark Matter__
	- Matter made of baryons (protons and neutrons) and electrons
	- too dark to detect wit current instruments
	- __Problem__:
		- measurements of light element abundances indicate that ordinary matter (stars, gas, dust, dark compact objects)
			can account for only about one-seventh of gravitationally observed mass in universe
		- ...with corroborating evidence from CMBR (gravitational interactions between ordinary and dark matter in early universe)

- __Exotic Dark Matter__
	- Non-baryonic matter
	- eg. WIMPS (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) - neutrino-like particles, but more massive

	- dark like neutrinos (no electric charge)
	- neutrinos are too light (moving too fast to clump together gravitationally)
	- hence: particle like neutrino, but more massive

## Role of Dark Matter in Galaxy Formation
- gravity of dark matter pulls mass into denser regions
	- universe grows lumpier with time
- gravity of dark matter caused protogalactic clouds to contract
	- preferentially aorund Dark Matter clumps
- WIMPs cant collapse to center cuz dont radiate away orbitall energy

- Dark matter still pulling things together
- can see that galaxies are flowing toward densest region of space (peculiar velocities)

- maps of galaxy positions reveal extremely large structures:
	- superclusters (chains and sheets) and voids

- Structure in observed galaxy maps look very similar to ones found in models in which dark matter is WIMPs

## Expansion of Universe
- each present slice of space has same volume
- and is expanding at same rate
- matter (mainly Dark Matter) exerts gravitational pull slowing down expansion

- measruements indicate that amount of matter (ordinary + dark) is ~25% OF critical density
	- expect expansion of universe to slow to a constant rate and continue forever

## Accelerated Expansion of Universe
- observations reveal that expansion of universe is speeding Ï…p
- CMBR reveal that on cosmic scale, space is flat
=> two interrelated facts imply existence of Dark Energy

Apparent brightness
	-> distance
	-> time in cosmic history
Redshift
	-> scale factor (size) of universe at that time
so get scale factor as function of cosmic time


Friedmann equation for acceleration of expansion:

	a^.. / a = - 4*pi*G * (E + 3P) / 3*c^2
	where E = energy per unit volumne, P = pressure

For matter (ordinary or dark), E > 0 and P is negligible
	-> decelerating expansion

For Dark Energy (eg. Einstein's cosmology constant), E > 0 and P = -E
	-> accelerating expansion

Dark Energy serves two roles
- has negative pressure that drives accelerated expansion
- contributes positive energy to make total energy critical

## Flatness of Space
- CMBR provides standard ruler
- apparent sizeof ruler is affect by curvature of space on cosmic scale
- measurements of CMBR indicate that universe has flat geometry
	-> critical total mass-energy

- Dark Energy is needed to fill out remaining mass-energy

	E_b + E_DM + E_DE ~ 0.04 + 0.22 + 0.74 = 1
