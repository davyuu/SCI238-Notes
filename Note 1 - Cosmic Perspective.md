##### The past is written in the sky
The further we look, the further back in time we see. At some point, it is so far back it reaches beginning of universe.

##### Evolution of the universe
Clue: More distant galaxies appear redder  
Einstein found that space itself expands. Light is stretched and pushes light waves to the red part of the spectrum. So the further the galaxy is, the redder they appear.   
Called **_redshift_**

#### Dark Energy
Dark energy is responsible for the expansion of the galaxy. This expansion of space due to dark energy is used to explain *redshift*

#### Where does the universe come from?
Night sky shows us that the universe had a beginning. Since there are no gaps in the night sky, there must be stars that have no reached us yet.

As we move out, we should find that the universe is dense and hot. In the beginning of time, space was completely filled with matter and was extremely hot and dense. There were small fluctuations.

At T0, time = 0, the entire observable universe was in a space smaller than the nucleus of an atom. This small universe suddenly expanded (called **inflation**) and the small fluctuations formed the universe.

#### Can we see this fiery beginning
**We can almost see the beginning**
At T1, time = 380,000 years, everywhere was filled with dense hot matter with tiny fluctuations.

Everyone's observable universe is centered around themselves. (13.7 billion year radius)

By looking at the edge of the universe at 13.7 billion years away, we can assume that our location was the same state.

**Inflation theory**: Early on, our big universe was really tiny but something happened that caused the space to expand really rapidly.

The tiny fluctuations were expanded to a cosmic size and turned into gigantic fluctuations that formed different gravity zones (eg. blue less-dense zones formed higher gravity zones that created suns). So we come from quantum fluctuations of the vacuum.

#### Why something rather than nothing?
**Quantum**: Spontaneous creation; something from nothing -- briefly

**Gravity**: Negative energy of gravity + positive energy of matter = 0? Energy is positive but gravity is negative. So from a fundamental perspective, the net energy of the universe could be 0.

According to Einstein, black holes are black and nothing can come out. According to Hawkings, black holes in a quantum context are not black but have a glow.

##### Questions
Was there a beginning?  
How did the universe get into the hot dense state 13.7 billion years ago?  
How can the universe exist at all?
