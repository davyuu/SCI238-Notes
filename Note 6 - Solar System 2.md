# Jovian (Giant) Planets

Giant planets are rapidly rotating, large gravitationally bound balls of fluid

Although gravity tends to pull fluid together into a sphere, rotation flattens this into an ellipsoid

Saturn is the most oblate giant planet

Jovian planets: all have differentiated interiors
- all are primary made of hydrogen and helium, even in outermost parts of their atmosphere, except in cores (rock and metals)

Differentiation of Jupiter's Interior
	~ 90% hydrogen
	~ 10% helium
	(by number of atoms)
	=> almost same as the Sun

Structure of Jupiter's Atmosphere
- as with terrestrial atmospheres: clouds, T (altitude)
- atmosphere ~ same structure
- differences: T_max, pressure, some composition

Bands in Jupiter's atmosphere:
- result of heat, convection, rotation (Coriolis)

Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a high pressure storm region

Saturn has bands and storms, but less prominent

Neptune and Uranus' blue colour: methane absorbs red Æ› and reflects blue

all 4 jovian planets have strong magnetic fields and huge magnetospheres
- Uranus and Neptune magnetic fields strongly tilted relative to rotation axis
- auroral zones near the magnetic poles

jovian planets (except Uranus) have extra internal head sources
- usual sources: primordial accretion & differentiation; radioactivity

Saturn: prominent ring system, more subtile bands

### Saturn
- similar to Jupiter but smaller
	- layered banded atmosphere
	- hydrogen/helium - but helium abundance about half of Solar in outer layers
	- strong magnetic field
	- metallic hydrogen and rocky core
	- rings are most massive and prominent of all

### Uranus
- accidentally discovered telescopically in 1781
- faint featuers, blue atmosphere
- hydrogen, helium, methane clouds
- strong magnetic field
- hydrogen not metallic, rocky core
- rotation axis tilted 98 degree -> very strong seasonal effect

almost completely featureless in visible light, but shows more detail in IR

### Neptune
- position predicted from observations of Uranus
- discovered in 1846
- very similar to Uranus, but not as hazy
	- more cloud features (isolated dark clouds above methane cloud layer)

Neptune shows large strom features, like Jupiter

The storms change over timescales of years or less

jovians satellites:
- some large, many small
- some geologically active, now or in the past
- some formed with planet, some captured

#### Jupiter's Large Satellites
- Io
	- geologically active
	- covered in orange sulfur
	- strongly tied to Jupiter's magnetic field

	- most volcanically active in SS
	- frequent, constantly changing its surface appearance
	- tidal interaction and eccentric orbit heat its interior
- Europa
	- smooth surface with few craters
	- water ice, possibly over liquid water
- Ganymede
	- largest moon in SS
	- water ice over much of surface
- Callisto
	- heavily cratered
	- concentric circular ridges are signs of large impact

Called the four Galilean satellites
- surface are increase and mean density decrease with distance from Jupiter

Charged particles escaping Io interact with Jupiter's magnetosphere => Io torus

Just below Europa's ice surface: 100km layers of liquid water or warm convecting ice? (Evidence: no crators, many cracks, gravity probes, induced magnetic field -> salt water?)

Ganymede (largest moon in SS): thicker ice crust, very deep ocean (magnetic field); both smooth and cracked terrain, the result of tidal heating + radioactive decay

Callistos surface is the oldest of the Galilean satellites
Gravity prob -> interior not differentiated. (No tidal heating)
Magnetic field -> super deep ocean? (radioactive heating)

#### Saturns Moons
- many moons, but large number still to be discovered
- Titan: largest moon - has dense, thick nitrogen atmos, extending far out into space and lakes of liquid methane/ethane
- innermost moons tidally locked to planet
- moons interact wit rings

#### Titan
Unique thick atmosphere:
- 90% nitrogen (like Earth) + argon, methane & ethane
- methane/ammonia ice vaporizes; solar UV breaks down NH3 -> nitrogen & methane -> ethane + organic chemicals

Saturn's medium sized moons: varied, enigamatic
- salty ice fountains of Enceladus suggests that it may have subsurface ocean
- heat source: tidal heating?

#### Uranus Moons
- more than 20 small ones, some irregular shape
- give midsized
- all icy, varied geological history
- Miranda shows fractured surface, few craters -> maybe cateclysmic event

#### Neptune Moons
- five small inner moons
- two large
- five small outer
- Triton
	- one of coldest worlds in SS
	- larger than any other Neptune moon
	- thin nitrogen atmos
	- surface has nitrogen geysers
	- retrograde (backwards) orbit
	- spiraling in towards Neptune

#### Rocky planets vs icy moons
- rock melts at higher temp
- only large rocky planets have enough heat for activity

- ice melts at low temp
- tidal heating can melt internal ince, driving activity

#### Saturn's Rings
brightest & best known
- within Roche Limit of Saturn, where any gravitationally bound bodies break up due to Sturn's strong tidal forces
- composed of icy particales with sizes btw 1 micron - 10 meters, orbiting indep liketiny moons, clumping/splitting
- features:
	- rings are very thin - at most 10s of meters, while > 270,000 km in diameter
	- fine rings within each ring, like record grooves
	- short-lives spokes
	- braided rings
	- shepherd satellites

Radio image: colours -> particle size
- purple: mainly >5cm
- green: mainly <1cm
- white: particle density too high

Spiral density waves also caused by orbital resonnances with moons
