# Milky Way Galaxy

- dusty gas clouds obscure view because they absorb visible light
- this is __interstellar medium__ that makes new star systems

## Orbit of Stars
- stars in disk all orbit in same direction with little up-and-down motion
- orbit of stars in bulge and halo have random orientations

- Sun's orbital motion (radius and velocity) tells us mass within Sun's orbit

	v_circ = sqrt( G*M / R )
		=> M(R) = R*v_circ^2 / G

		1.0 * 10^11 M_sun
		= 1.9 * 10^41 Kg

## Gas Recycling: Star-Gas-Star Cycle
- metal poor stars
	-> fusion creates heavier elements that enriches gas
	-> metal richer stars
- high mass stars have strong stellar winds that blow bubles of hot gas
- Lower mass stars return gas to interstellar space through stellar winds and planetary nebulae
- Xrays from hot gas in supernova remnants reveal newly made heavy elements
- supernova remnant cools and begins to emit visible light as it expands
- new elements made by supernova mix into interstellar medium

- radio emisions in supernova remnants is from particles accelerated to near light speed (synchotron radiation)
- cosmic rays probably come from supernovae

- multiple supernovae create huge hot bubbles that can blow out of the disk
- gas clouds cooling in halo can rain back down on disk

- both superbubbles and falling gas have been observed, but only part of story known is date

- __Atomic hydrogen gas__ forms as hot gas cools, allowing electrons to join wit protons
- __Molecular clouds__ form next, after gas cools enough to allow atoms to combine into molecules

- gravity forms stars out of gas in molecular clouds, completing star-gas-star cycle
- radiation from newly formed stars is eroding these star forming clouds

- Stars make new elements by fusion
- dying stars expel gas and elements, produing hot bubbles (~10^6 K)
- hot gas cools, allowing atomic hydrogen clouds to form (~ 100-10,000 K)
- further cooling permits molecules to form, making molecular clouds (~30 K)
- gravity forms new stars (and planets) in molecular clouds

a. 21cm radio waves emitted by atomic hydrogen show where gas has cooled and settled into disk
b. radio emmision from carbon monoxide reveals molecular clouds
c. Infrared (60-100 Ï…m) emiision from interstellar dust
d. infrared (1-4 um) emission from stars, which penetrates most interstellar material
e. visible light emitted by stars, scattered and absorbed by dust
f. Xray emiision from hot gas bubble annd Xray binaries
g. Gamma rays emission from collisions of cosmic rays wit atomic nuclei in interstellar clouds

## Star Formation Regions
- __Ionization nebulae__ are found around short-lived high-mass stars, signifying active star formation
- __Reflection nebulae__ scatter light from stars
- __Halo__: no ionization nebulae, no blue stars => no star formation
- __Disk__: ionization nebulae, blue stars => star formation

## Winding Dilemma
- stars nearer the center will complete orbits in less time than stars furthur out
- spiral arms should thus wind up in few rotations but dont

## Density Wave Model
- Spiral arms are self-sustaining "density waves"
- gas clouds slow down & get squeezed as they move into spiral arms.
- squeezing of clouds triggers star formation
- young stars flow out of spiral arms

## History of Milky Way
- Halo Stars: 0.02-0.2 heavy elements, only old stars
- Disk Stars: 2% heavy elements, stars of all ages
- Halo stars formed first, then stopped
- Disk stars formed later, kept forming

## Galaxy Formation
- formed from cloud of intergalactic gas
- Halo stars formed first as gravity caused gas to contract
- remaining gas settled into spinning disk
- stars continuously form in disk as galaxy grows older
- detailed studies show that halo stars formed in clumps that later merged
- What clues to our galaxy's history do halo stars hold?
	- Halo stars are all old, wit smaller proportion of heavy elements that disk stars
	- indicates that halo formed first
- How did our galaxy form
	- Halo stars formed early in history
	- Disk stars formed later, after much of gas settled into spinning disk

## Galactic Center
- stars appear to be orbiting something massive but invisible
	- black hole?
- orbits of stars indicate mass of about 4 million M_sun
- Xray flares from galactic center suggest that tidal forces of suspected black hole occasionally tear appart chunks of matter about to fall in
