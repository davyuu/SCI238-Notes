## Formation of SS
- Patterns are clues, exceptions too
- star foramtion as part of process
- planet formation

Must explain:
1. large SS bodies have ordely motions
2. two types of major planets
	- small, rocky terrestrial inner planets
	- large, hydrogen-rich jovian outer planets
3. asteroids, commets, other small bodies in certain places
4. exceptions to patterns

## Nebular Model of SS Formation
- Solar system formed from giant, swiling gloud of gas and dust that gravitationally contracted to form most of what we see today
- depends on three basic laws of physics
	- Law of gravity (contraction)
	- Conservation of energy (heating)
	- Conservation of angular momentum (spinning up)
- plus basic chemistry

## Solar Nebula
- nebular model says that SS formed out of a nebula (interstellar gas cloud) that collapsed under own gravity
- observational evidence
	- observe starts in process of forming today
	- always found within interstellar clouds of gas

## Gravitation Collapse
- solar nebula initially few light years in diameter
	- diameter ≥ Oort Cloud > 10^3 Kuiper Build scale > 10^4 Jupiter's orbit
	- very cold
	- slight, random rotation (averaged out over cloud)
- began to cnotract
	- perhaps started by shock wave from nearby supernova
- as nebula shrank, gravity increased, avverlerating colapse
- as nebula falls inward, gravitational pot energy -> kinetic energy -> thermal energy & radiation (needed!)
	- __Conservation of Energy__
- as nebula radius decrease, rotate faster
	- __Conservation of Angular Momentum__

## Flattening of Solar Nebula
- as nebula colpase, clumps of gas collide and merge
- random velocities avg out to nebula's direction of rotation (similar to Satrun's rings)
- spinning nebula ssumes shape of disk

## SS Motions vs Nebular Model Predictions
- Sun formed in very center of nebula
	- when temp and density were high enough, nuclear fusion reactions began
- planets formed in rest of disk
- would explain:
	- all planets lie on one plane (in disk)
	- all planets orbit in one direction (spin direction of disk)
	- Sun rotates in same direction (why slow?)
	- planets tend to rotate in same direction
	- most moons orbit in this direction
	- most planetary orbits ~ circular (collisions in disk)

- We have observed flattened, spinning disks around other stars
	- even with what appears to be a jovian-like plannet

## Why two kinds of planets?
- Materials available to be incorporated into planets
- condensation temp of materials
- location in solar nebula

## Building Planets
- only rocks & metals condensed within 3.5 AU of SUN
	- called __frost line__
- Hydrogen compounds (ices) (and rocks and metals) condensed beyond frost line
- __accretion__: small grains stick to one another via electrostatic force until are massive enough to attraact via gravity to form...
- ...__planetesimals__ (small bodies orbiting Sun) which will:
	- combine inside frostline to form rocky planets
	- combine outside frostline to form rocky and icy planetesimals... which capture H/He far from Sun to form gas planets (cold -> sppeds < escape speed)
- each gas (jovian) planet formed its own miniature solar nebula, out of which their moons formed

## Solar Wind
- charged particles streaming out from new Sun cleared away leftover gas
	- most of mass of solar nebula was initially gas
- solar wind cannot move objects much larger than small grain of dusy
	- all rocks (and large) are not affected by solar wind
- timescale for solar wind "cleanout" vs planetesimal formation? (Too fast -> no gas giants)

1. cloud contracts, spins, up, flattens
2. H, He stay as gas, most other elements condense out
3. planetesimals grow, outer ones accrete more gas
4. solar wind eventually removes remaining gas

## Origin of Asteroids
- Solar wind did not remove leftover rocky planetesimals
- Jupiter prevented some from accreting into a planet...these are present-day asteroids

## Origin of Comets
- Solar wind did not remove leftover icy planetesimals...these are present-day comets
- those between jovian planets were
	- captured
	- gravitationally flung in all directions into Oort cloud
- those beong Neptune's orbit remained in ecliptic plane in __Kuiper belt__

## Exceptions
- what caused heavy bombardment
	- huge number of craters found on Moon
- how did Earth get such a large moon
- how do we explain retrograde motions
- why do some of planets have such greatly tilted rotation axes

## Heavy Bombardment
- there were many more leftover planetesimals than we see today
- most collided with newly-formed planets & moons during first few 100 million years of SS
- later migrations of gas giants caused scattering

## Origin of lareg Moon
- hypothesis: Mars-sized leftover smalled into Earth, blacking rock from Earth's outer layers into orbit, where it re-accreted to form Moon
- we see evidence of massive collisions in other places in SS
- also: composition of Moon & computer simulations

## More Exceptions to Rules: close encounters, impacts
- why do some moons orbit opposite to their planet's rotation direction?
	- captured moons, eg Triton
- why are rotation axes of some planets tilteed
	- impacts knock them over (extreme example: Uranus)
- why do some planets rotate more quickly/slowly than others
	- impacts "spin them up/down" (extreme example: Venus)

## Recent discovereies
- Material returned from comets
	- Project Stardust collected material from Commet Wild 2, expected to find pre-solar material left over from cold outer edges of presolar nebula
		- instead found some material formed at very high temp, near young Sun (4.567 billion years ago), and tarnsported to Kuiper belt
		- also found amino acid glycine (first detection of glycine in a comet)
- Origin of Earth's Oceans
	- 50 year old theory: comets as source of oceans
		- Deuterium (D) abundances: oceans vs commets.
		- Prev measurements of 6 Oort Cloud comets gave D abunances twice as high as in oceans
		- in Oct 2011, using Hershchel/HIFI, measurement of Kuiper Belt comet 103P/Hartley 2 gave same abundance as oceans

## Other Planetary Systems
- based on solar nebula model, scientists expected virtually all stars to have planets.
- before 1988, number of known exoplanets was zero
- since 1988, we real data
	- ~2000 planets discovred to date in ~1100 systems
	- plus a few thousand additional candidates (Kepler)
- Extrapolation from data
	- >100 billion planets in Milky Way (avg one per star)
	- ~10 billion Earth-szied planets in habitable zone of Sun-like stars in Milky Way alone~

## Other Planetary Stsetms...Exosolar Planets
habitable zone: not too hot/cold -> liquid water

## Methods of Detecting Exoplanets
- Direct (at edge of present tech)
	- angle between star and its planets, as seen from Earth, mostly too small to resolve wit biggest telescopes
	- a star like Sun would be billion times brighter than light reflected by planets -> planets lost glare
	- planets are birghtest (& stars usually dimmer) in infrared
- Indirect (technologically feasible)
	- Wobble of planet star
		- Astrometric method (GAIA)
		- Doppler method
	- Transit method

## Doppler Method
- Planet and star orbit common center of mass
- Periodic wobble of star -> periodic shift in radial velocity
- Detect by observing periodic shift in spectrum of starlight

1. Period of wave -> planet's orbital period -> radius (Kepler)
2. Amplitude of wave -> radial speed -> mass of planet
3. Distortion of wave (!= sin wave) -> orbital eccentricity

## Orbital Period and Radius
Example: P = 4.23 d

	P^2 = ( ( 4 pi^2 ) / ( G * ( M + m ) ) ) * a^3
		= 4 * pi^2 * a^3 / G * M

	Estimate (by other means)

		M ~= 1.06 M_sun

	Calculate a ~= 7.8 * 10^9 m = 0.052 AU (<Mercury)

	Note: non-distorted sine wave -> nearly circular orbit

## Mass of Planet
measure: V = 57 m/s
if we are seeing system on edge on:

	MV = mv -> m = MV / v
	v = 2*pi*r / P ~= 2*pi*a / P

	m = M*V*P / 2*pi*a = 9 * 10^26 kg = 0.47 M_jup

	Note: this is a minimum mass. If system is not edge-on, planet's mass must be larger to produce same shifts in radial velocity as seen from Earth

## Main-Sequence Stars (stably fusing H -> He)
- Blue giants:
	- Bright & high mass -> supernova
	- Least abundant and too short-lived for life to likely eveolve
- Red dwarfs:
	- Dim & low mass -> longest-lived
	- most abundant but brightness varies
	- planet must be close -> tidal heating and tidal locking
	- feasibility for life is currently being debated
- Giants:
	- Stars in transition state or death throes
- White dwarfs
	- end state of 97% of stars
	- heavier stars end as neutron star or black hole
- Sun like stars are just right

## Transit Method (eg. Kepler Mission)
- requires : edge-on view (probablility ~ 1/200)
- planet in front of star -> reduced visible light -> planet size
- star in front of planet -> reduced infrared light -> planet Τ
- ..can also get info about atmosphere (spectrum)
- Planet's orbital period, P, equals transit period
- Object orbital radius, a, same as in Doppler method
- Planet's radius, r, assuming we know star's radius, R:

		B = fraction of light blocked (eg. 0.015) = pi*r^2 / pi*R^2
		r = sqrt(B)*R = 0.12R

## Infrared emission from exosolar planets
- stars are fainter at infrared wavelengths while emission from planets is strongest in infrared
	- glare of star relative to planet is less at infrared than at visible wavelengths
- during orbit of planet around star, we see phases of planet
	- most of day side facing us just before planet goes behind star
	- most of night side at or near transit
	- can see this as small change in infrared emission
		- get direct measruement of atmosphere temp and day/night temp diff

## Kepler Mission
(transit method)
145,000 main-sequence stars, imaged every 30 mins to detect birghtness cahgnes
as of July 2015
	- candidiate planets = 4696
	- confirmed planets = 1030

## Combine
assuming edge-on
- get __mass__ from Doppler method
- get __size__ from transit method
- combine to get avg density
	- rocky
	- gaseous
	- other
