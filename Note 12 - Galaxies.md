# Galaxies

- nearby galaxies ~ same age
	-> all galaxies formed near beginning of universe > 10 billion years ago
- nearby galaxies are old
- faraway galaxies are young
- galaxy evolution happens on cosmic time scale

- galaxy classification is porphological: based on appearance

## Spiral Galaxies
- Disk component: stars of all ages, many gas & dust clouds
- Spheroidal component: bulge and hao, old stars, few gas & dust clouds
- blue-white color indicates ongoing star formation
- red-yellow color indicates older star population

- __Barred spiral galaxy__: has bar-shaped bulge
- face-on spiral galaxies vary widely in appearance
	- shows dust, gas, bulge

Note: galaxies are large, but appear small becuase far away
- apparent __angular size__ of Andromeda only a few times greater than Moon's
- Andromeda is 700 kpc (2.5 Mly) away
	- true (linear) diameter is >10^14 times greater than moon

## Lenticular Galaxy
- has a disk and bulge like spiral galaxy
- must less dusty gas (between spiral and elliptical)

## Elliptical Galaxy
- large spheroidal balls of stars, wit little gas and dust, no disks
- vary greatly in size and mass

## Irregular Galaxies
- have little symmetry, often include gas

## Grouping of Galaxies
- spiral galaxies often in groups of galaxies
- elliptical galaxies more common in huge __clusters__ of galaxies (100-1000 galaxies)

# Summary
- How lives of galaxies connected wit history of universe
	- galaxies formed when universe young have aged wit universe
- What are three major types of galaxies
	- spiral, elliptical, irregular
	- spiral have both disks and spheroidal comps
	- elliptical have no disks
- How galaxies grouped
	- spirals groups few dozens
	- elliptical large cluster hundreds to thousands

## Measuring distance
- scale of SS accurately determined by radar ranging
- determines size of Earth's orbit

- ground-based parallax works out to few hundred light years

- __standard candle__: object whose luminosity (intrinsic brightness) is known
- measure apparent brightness and calculate distance
	b = L / 4*pi*d^2

- Standard Candle #1: Main-sequence fitting
- Standard Candle #2: Cepheid variables
- Stardard Candle #3: Type1a supernovae (WD in binary system)
- Standard Candle #4: Tully-Fisher relation: more massive galaxy = more luminous

- Galaxy mass and brightness roughly proportional
- Measure mass independently of distance from rotation (velocity dispersion)

## Edwin Hubble
- first ot measure distance to Andromeda (using Cepheid variables)
	- proved that universe is much large than Milky Way
- discovered universe expanding

- spectral features of virtually all galaxies are redshifted
	-> moving away from us
- further away are moving faster
	velocity = H_o * distance

Measure redshift -> recessional velocity -> distance
	d = v / H_o

Since Einstein's general theory of relativity, galactic redshift is interpreted not as galaxies moving away from us
	but as galaxies at rest in expanding space

## Galaxy Evolution
- best model for galaxy formation
	- matter originally filled all of space uniformly
	- gravity of denser regions pulled in surrounding matter
	- denser regions contracted, forming __protogalactic clouds__
	- hydrogen and helium gas in these clouds
	- supernova explosions from first stars kept mcuh of gas from forming stars
	- leftover gas settled into spinning disk due to conservation of angular momentum
- spin:
	-> low initial angular momentum could result in almost radial collapse
	-> elliptical galaxy
- density:
	-> high initial density
	-> efficient cooling
	-> star formation used up gas before can settle into disk
	-> elliptical galaxy
- collisions:
	-> spiral galaxies collide
	-> eliptical galaxy
	... collisions likely in early, smaller universe
- starbust galaxy: intense star formation triggered by collision between two galaxies
- modeling on comp show that two spiral galaxies can merge into elliptical

## Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)
- if center of galaxy is unusually bright
	- call __active galactic nucleus__
- rare close eto us but common at large distance
- Quasars are most distance and luminous examples

## Quasars
- extremely high redshift -> quasars are very distant (young)
- apparent brightness & distance -> luminosities > 10^12 L_sun
- Rapid variations in brightness (scale of hours)
	-> all this energy comes from region smaller than SS
- galaxies around quasars sometimes appear disturbed by collisions
- quasars radiate powerfully over wide range of wavelengths
	-> contain matter wit wide range of temps
	- have both thermal and non-thermal comps

## Radio Galaxies
- __Radio galaxies__ contains active nuclei shooting out vast jets of plasma that emits radio waves coming from electrons that move at near light speed
- high ejection speeds from quasar suggests presence of black hole
- idea: radio galaxies dont appear as quasars because dusty gas clouds block our view of accretion disk
- current model of central "engine" of an active galaxy

- Accretion of gas onto supermassive black hole appear sto be only way to explain all properties of quasars

## Energy from black hole
- grav PE of matter spiralling toward black hole turns into KE
- friction in accretion disk turns KE into TE (heat)
- heat prduces thermal radiation (photons)
- process can convert 10 to 40% of E = mc^2 into radiation
	- (compared to <1% efficiency of stellar fusion)
- Jets are thought to come from twisting of mag fields in inner part of accretion disk
- orbital speed and distance of gas orbiting center of M87 indicate black hole wti M = 3to6 million M_sun

## Origin of Supermassive Black Holes
- growing evidence that all large galaxies have central supermassive black hole
	- and that black hole masses correlate wit gaalxy mass
- did black holes form first, out of protogalactic gas?
- or large stars -> many NS & BH remnants -> coalesce into BH

- redshift tells distance of clouds
- most distant clouds have stronger H-absorption (more H, less stars) and less metal
- nearer clouds ahve weaker H-absorption (less H, more stars) and more metals
