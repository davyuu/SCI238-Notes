# Stars: Birth, Life, Death

## Stellar Nurseries
- gas between stars called __interstellar medium (ISM)__
- Stars form in __molecular clouds__ (H_2)
	- relatively cold, dense and dusty region of ISM

## Composition of clouds
- most of matter in star-forming clouds in form of gas molecules
	- temp of 10-30K and density of ~300 molecules per cubic centimeter

## Interstellar Dust
- __dust grains__ < micrometer in size
- long-wavelength infrared light passes through cloud more easily than visible light, revealing stars on other side
- visible light from newborn star often trapped in dark, dusty gas clouds when star formed

## Glowing Dust Grains
- dust grains that absorb visible light heat up and emit infrared and mm wavelengths

## Cloud Collapse - Gravity vs Pressure
- Gravity tends to collapse a cloud but even a cold moledular cloud has outward theremal pressure opposing collapse
- Only clouds of sufficient mass will gravity overcome thermal pressure

Need: M_cloud > M_balance = 18*M_sin*sqrt(T^3/n)

M_balance is larger for higher T clouds (higher pressure)
M_balance is smaller for higher n clouds (stronger gravity)

Typical clouds: T = 30K, n = 300 /cm^3
	-> M_cloud > 170 M_sun
	...enough mass for many stars

__Collapse__: Gravitational Pot Energy -> Kinetic Energy -> Thermal Energy (higher temp) -> Higher Pressure:
	P = nkT
This would halt collapse. Collapse can continue only if cloud can get rid of extra thermal energy

Collisions excite (mainly CO) molecular rotation & vibration states
	-> de-excite by emitting infrared and radio photons that escape the cloud, taking extra energy with them
allows cloud to collapse to higher density and pressure without heating up (~constant temp)

As cloud shrinks, n increases (for roughly constant T)
	-> M_balance decreases
	-> smaller mass limit for contraction
	-> _fragmentation__
	-> typically many stars form from one cloud

## First Stars
- No heavy elements to make molecular clouds
	- only H_2, He
- No CO molecules to provide cooling
	- only H_2 molecules, whose rotation/vibration states get excited only at higher T
- Higher T -> higher M_balance -> larger clouds -> first stars must have been very large ~100 M_sun
- Burn fast -> supernova -> heavy elements very early

	M_cloud > M_balance = 18 * M_sun * sqrt( T^3 / n )

## Collpasing Cloud -> Protostar
- contraction increases density of molecules and cust particles
	- harder for radio/infrared photons to escape
- Gravitational PE -> thermal enery, increasing core T -> P increases sharply due to increasing n and T (P = nkT)
- Sharply increasing P slows contraction
	-> core of cloud fragment becomes __protostar__
		hot like a star, but energy from gravitation contraction, not fusion

## Growth of Protostar
- matter from cloud rains down on protostar til stellar wind from protostar or neighbor star blows away remaining cloud

## Add rotation
- contracting clod fragment always begins wit random, net rotation
- conservation of angular momentum -> rotation speeds up as cloud collapse
- collisions between particles cause cloud to flatten into disk
- rotation slowed by fraction of accretion disk, stellar wind, magnetic field and bipolar jets

## Protostar -> MS Star (Fusion)
- temp at core of protostar starts at ~1 million K (from gravitational contraction)
- Contraction continues til core hot enough for fusion (~10 million K)
- Contraction stops when energy released by fusion balances energy radiated from surface
	-> now main-sequence star

- Higher mass stars form more quickly
- Lower mass stars form omre slowly

# Summary
- where do stars come from
	- form in dark, dusty clouds of molecular gas wit temp of 10-30 K
	- clouds mostly made of H_2, and CO
- why do stars form
	- clouds massive enough for gravity to overcome thermal pressure (M_cloud > M_balance)
	- cloud contracts and breaks up into fragments
		- each contracts and forms protostar
	- emiision from CO and dust particles allows contraction to continue (keeps cloud cool)
- What slows contraction
	- higher particle density
		-> infrared and radio photons cant escape
		-> T, P build up, which resists crush of gravity
- What role of rotation
	- conservation of angular momentum leads to formation of accretion disks around protostar
- how does nuclear fusion begin
	- gravitational contract continue cause core to grow hot and dense enough for fusion
	- fusion power in core comes into balance eit thermal rediation from surface -> MS star

## Smallest Mass Stars
- thermal pressure can slow contraction but next stop it
	- protostar constantly losing theremal energy from surface through radiation
- with sufficiently high mass, core temp eventually reaches 10 million K and outward thermal pressure due to fusion stops furthur contraction
- if mass not high enough, diff kind of pressure stops future contraction before core is hot enough for fusion
	- __quantum mechanical electron degeneracy pressure__
- Electron obey Pauli Exclusion principle
	- they fill core, each must be in diff state
- at high enough density, some have fast enough quantum motion to exert sufficient pressure to balance gravity
- thermal pressure depends on n and T.
	- P = nkT
- P_deg depends on n only, not T
- usuualy, P_deg << P_therm
	- low mast stars require only a small P, which P_deg can reach before T ~ 10 million K

## Brown Dwarfs
- degeneracy pressure stpos contraction wit 0.08M_sun before core temp hot enough for H->He fusion

## Largest mass stars
- photons exert slight pressure when they hit matter
- very massive stars very luminous that photon pressure drives matter into space
- radiation pressure limits how massive star can be without blowing up
	max ~ 150 M_sun?

## Mass Range
~ 0.08Msun -> 150Msun

higher mass -> higher T -> more rapid fusion
	-> more luminous and shorter lived
lower mass -> lower T -> slower fusion rates
	-> less luminous and longer lived

## Main sequeunce of low mass stars
- as 4H->He, density of particles in core decreases
- causing slow, steady core contraction
	- core n increase (restoring density)
	- gravitational PE -> KE
	- core T increase (restoring pressure/gravity balance)
- hotter core -> higher fusion rate and hotter, expanded envelop (region outside core)
- MS star slowly becomse larger and more luminous

## Red Giant Phase
- when coer H too low to sustain H->He fusion, core contracts and heating accelerates
- envelope -> hotter adn expands rapidly
	- fusion moves to shell around growing, inert He core
- Luminosity increase and star moves off MS to red giant
- star expands and eventually cools

- H buring shell steadily deposits helium ash on inert helium core -> contracting and heating
- core struggles to get hot enough for He fusion (~10^8K)
	- core becomes degenerate
- When T_critiacl finally reached, He ignition is sudden: __helium flash__
- He -> C fusion stage moves star back to Main sequence

## He burning
- core exapnds and cools, causing H shell burning to stop
	- star cols and shrinks
- star again burning nuclear fuel in core

## Double shell burning
- after core He runs out, He->C fusion moves to a shell around inert C core that is grwoing in mass, shrinking in size
- H-He fusion continues in shell around He buring shell
- double sehll-burning stage never reaches equilibirum
	- fusion rate fluctuates in series of thermal pulses
- with each pulse, convection dredges carbon up from core and transports to surface
	-> C in carbon-based life

## Planetary Nebula
- Double shell burning ends with final pulse that ejects H and He outer layers into space as __planetary nebula__
- Carbon core left behind becomes degenerate __white dwarf__

### Layers
1. nonfusing hydrogen
2. hydrogen fusion
3. helium fusion
4. carbon fusion
5. oxygen, neon and magnesium fusion
6. silicon fusion
7. inert icon core

fusion of elemetns below iron releases energy
fusion of elements above iron consumes energy

## End stages of High mass star
- no fusion in inert icon core -> thermal pressure drops core compressing
	- now balanced by degeneracy pressure
- Icon ash continually deposited on core -> core density increase
- electron speeds -> c
	- degeneracy pressure begins to fail
- core begins to collapse
	- p+ + e- -> n^o + v
- Electron degeneracy pressure instantly fails
- surface of core freefals to ~1/4 c
- tremendous amount of gravitational PE released ~10^46 J (!)
- collapse halted by higher neutron degeneracy pressure
	-> bounce
	-> outward shock wave
	-> elements heavier than iron (only known process)
- core temp ~100 billion K
	- thermal v-v pairs cool neutron core, and radiate most of 10^46 J from PE_grav
- only ~10^44 J involved in visible supernova blast
- remnant = neutron star (supported by neutron degeneracy pressure)
	- or black hole, depending on star's initial mass

## Evolution of high mass star
- core H burning (CNO cycle) MS star
- H shell burning red supergiant
- He core burning blue supergiant
- plus later core reactions, multiple shell burning
- core collapse supernova

## White Dwarfs
- end stage of stars < 8M_sun
- supportsed against gravity by electron degeneracy rpessure (depends only on n, not T)
- start UV/X-ray hot, then gradually cools to zero
- can be made of He, C, O
- higher mass white dwards are samller (P_deg is quantum)

## Limit
- quantum mechanics -> electron must move faster as they are squeezed into small space (Heisenberg Uncertainty)
- as white dwarf's mass approaches 1.4M_sun, electron speeds appraoch speed of light
- nothing can move faster than light, white dwarf cannot be more massive thatn 1.4M_sun
	- __White dwarf limit__ or Chandrasekhar limit

## Fate of White Dwarf in Close binary
- move massive star evolves first to giant or super giant
- mass in outer envelope of expanded star trasferred to less massive companion
	- eventually beome more massive component
- originally more massive star evolves to white dwarf and companion to giant
- __Nova__: string tidal force of white dwarf transfers mass to white dwarf surface
	- accumulation, compression and heating can lead to sudden, breif ignition of H->He fusion
- nova cycles repeat ~10,000 y
- if there is net accumulation of mass, can have M -> 1.4M_sun
- __White dwarf (type 1) supernova__
	- electron speeds -> c
	- P_deg beings to fail
	- collapse starts
	- core density and T increase
	- carbon fusion flash of entire star
	- detonation destroys star
	- ~10 billion L_sun

## Neutron Stars
- ball of neutrons left behind by massive-star supernova
	- supported against garvity by neutron degeneracy pressure
- smaller, denser than white dwarf
	- 1M_sun neutron star ~ 10km diameter

## Pulsars
- rapidly rotating, magnetized neutron star
- beans radiation along magnetic axis
- sweep through space like lighthouse beans as NS rotates

## Why Pulsars must be Neutron Stars
- Circumference of NS = 2pi (radius) ~ 60 km
- Spin rate of fast pulsars ~ 1000 cycles per second
- Surface rotation speed
	- ~ 60,000 km/s
	- ~ 20% speed of light
	- ~ escape velocity from NS

## Neutron Stars in close binary
similar to white dwarf in close binary except
- hotter accretion disk (X-ray vs UV) -> X-ray binary
- more energetic novae (He vs H fusion) -> X-ray bursts
- For pulsars, can observe rates of
	- spin down (isolated NS)
	- spin up (accreting NS in binary)
- End states
	- M_NS ~ 3M_sun -> black hole?
	- Ns + (NS or BH) -> coalesce into BH?

## Black holes
- max mass of neutron star is ~ 2-3 M_sun
- if massive star supernova remnant > 3M_sun
	- dont know what else except black hole

black holes:
- theoretically predicted by Einstein's model of gravity
- believable models of physical collapse to BH
- strong observational evidence for
	- stellar mass BHs (supernova remnants > 3 M_sun)
	- supermassive BHs (at centre of many galaxies)

Einstein: Gravity = Geometry
- black hole is most extreme case of curved spacetime
	- warping of space
	- warping of time
- resulting in __event horizon__: spherical surface in space at which
	v_esc = sqrt( 2*G*M / R ) = c
inside, v_esc > c => nothing escapes

- black hole only little smaller than neutron star of same mass
