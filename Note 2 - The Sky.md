# The Sky

#### Naked eye astronomy
- stars and constellations (88) / "asterisms"
- rotation of the Earth and "sky coordinates"
- phases of the moon
- ecliptic: path of the Sun & planets in the sky
- seasons
- time

#### Main point: Motions appear complex because
1. motions are not all circular
2. motions are not all in same plane
3. we are on the Earth, spinning and moving

### Motions in the Sky
- daily rotation of the sky (of Earth)
- motion of the Moon and "phases"
- motion of the Sun from one day to the next
	- hard to notice, because when the Sun is up, you cant see the stars
	- but the Sun is in a slightly difference part of the sky (wrt the stars) every...how can you tell that this is true
- motion of planets

Stars move "around the sky"

Rotation of the Earth causes apparent rotation in the sky. So constellations appear in different places.

Stars appear to lie on a great "celestial sphere" around the Earth.  
Earth's rotation makes the celestial sphere appear to rotate about us (from E to W)

##### Sky rotation at the Equator
Stars near the celestial equator make almost straight lines.

### Location on the Sky
**Right ascension**: like longitude on celestial sphere (measured in hours wrt spring equinox)
**Declination**: like latitude on celestial sphere (measured in degrees above celestial equator)

##### Example
How high in "your" sky will an object be?
- we are at latitude of 44 degrees. On 21 Dec, the Sun is at a declination of -23.5 degrees (would be seen directly overhead at noon at latitude of -23.5 degrees)
- how high in the sky (altitude) is the Sun at noon?

	180 - (44 + 23.5 + 90) = 22.5 degrees

### Separation of Object on the Sky
- Angular separation:
	- measured in degrees, (arc)minutes, (arc)seconds
	- 1 degree = 60 arcmin = 3600 arcsec
		1 degree = 60' == 3600''
	- Often measured down to a precision arcsecond
-Linear (or physical) separation, assuming the objects are at essentially the same distance from us:
	s = rQ (Q in radians => 2pi radians = 360 degrees)

	**Approx:  
	a ~ s = rQ**

Example
	Q = (0.518 / 360) * 2pi  
	r = 384,000 km  
	=> a = rQ = 384,000 km * (0.518 / 360) * 2pi  
		= 3470 km

### Moon & its Phases
- New Moon: 0 days (Not visible)
- Waxing crescent: 4 days
- First quarter: 7 days (Rises at noon and sets at midnight)
- Waxing gibbous: 10 days
- Full Moon: 14 days (Rises at sunset and sets at sunrise)
- Waning gibbous: 18 days
- Third quarter: 22 days (Rises at midnight and sets at noon)
- Waning crescent: 26 days


#### Moon's Orbit
- Elliptical, not circular (eccentricity ~ 0.0549)
	- Sometimes closer to Earth (so larger), or further (smaller)
- Not in same plane as Earth's orbit around the Sun
	- Inclined by 5.1 degrees to the ecliptic
	- Orbit has complicated "precessions" (Newton)

#### The Sun's Changing Position in the Sky
Q: What is the tilt angle between the ecliptic and the equator planes?  
Ecliptic = Sun's path against background stars due to Earth's motion around the Sun.

Sun's path against the background stars is through the constellations of the "zodiac"

#### Paths of the Planets Across the Sky
Since all planets orbit the Sun in very nearly the same plane (the plane of Earth's orbit), their paths against the background stars also lie roughly along the ecliptic

The seasons are primarily caused by the tilt of Earth's rotation axis to its orbital plane
- Spring Equinox: The Sun shines equally on both hemispheres. Northern Hemisphere is entering spring; Southern Hemisphere is entering fall
- Summer Solstice: Northern Hemisphere receives its most direct sunlight of the year (beginning of summer); Southern Hemisphere receives its least direct sunlight (beginning of winter)
- Fall Equinox: The Sun shines equally on both hemispheres. Northern Hemisphere is entering fall; Southern Hemisphere is entering spring.
- Winter Solstice: Northern Hemisphere receives its last direct sunlight of the year (beginning of winter); Southern Hemisphere receives its most direct sunlight (beginning of summer).

**Note**: The Earth's orbit is slight elliptical. It is closest to the Sun at the beginning of January and furthest at the beginning of July (diff of about 5 million km). Seasons have nothing to do with distance to the Sun.

**Note**: The greater the tile angle of the ground to the incoming sunlight, the greater area the Sun's energy is spread over, and the less warming effect the Sun has. It's almost all about the tilt angle!

**Question**: Are there other factors that affect the seasons?

### Types of "Day"
**Sidereal Day**: Earth's rotational period relative to the stars
	= 23h 56m 4.09s  
**Solar Day**: Sun's apparent rotation period (high noon to high noon)
	= 24h  

Q = 360 degrees / 365.25 degrees ~= 1 degree extra rotation of Earth

### Sun's Apparent Motion on the Sky
Due to Earth's tilt, the height of the Sun changes throughout the year in a sinusoidal wave pattern.
	0 -> 23.5 -> 0 -> -23.5 -> 0

### Variations in Length of Solar Day
##### Variation due to tilt of Earth's axis  
**obliquity**: The Sun's apparent eastward speed against the background sky is fastest at the solstices (June & December) and slowest at the equinoxes (march * September).

Faster speed at solstice -> more "extra" rotation of Earth -> solar days are slightly longer than the mean solar day (24h). Accumulation of longer solar days -> Sun gets behind clocks.

Slower speed at equinoxes -> less "extra" rotation of Earth -> solar days are slightly shorter than the mean solar day (24h). Accumulation of shorter solar days -> Sun gets ahead of clocks.

##### Variation due to Earth's elliptical orbit  
**eccentricity**: According to Kepler's Area Law (more later), Earth moves fastest in January (when at perihelion - closest to Sun) and slowest in July (when at aphelion - furthest from Sun).

Thus, the Sun's apparent eastward speed against the background sky is thus fastest in January and slowest in July.

Adding up the two effects (obliquity and eccentricity) give the equation of time

**Analemma**: Minutes the clock is ahead or behind the Sun as a function of date and the Sun's declination.

The analemma as seen in the sky by taking photographs of the Sun's position over the year at 12 noon mean solar time -> shape of bowling pin or uneven figure 8.

### Types of Month
**Sidereal Month**: time for Moon to orbit Earth = 27.3 days.  
Earth travels ~ 360 degrees / 12 = 30 degrees around Sun during that time.

**Synodic Month**: time for one cycle of lunar phases (new Moon to new Moon) = 27.3 + 27.3/12 = 29.5 or 1/12 longer than a sidereal month.

### Planetary Periods
Planetary periods can be measured wrt the stars (orbital or sidereal period) or relative to the position of the Sun (synodic period)

Differences between a planet's orbital (sidereal) and synodic period depends on how far the planet moves in 1 Earth year

For outer planets:  

	P_orb = P_syn * (1 yr / (P_syn - 1 yr))

For inner planets:

	P_orb = P_syn * (1 yr / (P_syn + 1 yr))

#### Transits
On rare occations, an inner plannet will be perfectly aligned with the Sun during inferior conjunction, causing a **transit** across Sun's surface.

### The Moon
Moon's orbit around Earth is elliptical (e = 0.0549)  
Moon's axis of rotation is tilted 6.58 degree to orbital plane  
Orbital plane is tilted 5.14 degree to the plane of the ecliptic

#### Lunar Libration
Libration in longitude due to varying speed of Moon around elliptical orbit

Libration in latitude due to the 6.58 degree tilt of the Moon's rotation axis relative to its orbital plane.

Diurnal (daily) libration due to Earth's rotation, carrying observers from one side of the Earth to the other, allowing observers to see a little bit around the Moon, to one side or the other.

Fluctuations in the Moon's apparent size due to the eccentricity of its orbit.

- Lunar Eclipse: when the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow (the Moon disappears)
 	- can happen only at full Moon (but not all full Moons)
	- Earth is between the Sun and the Moon
	- Earth blocks sunlight from illuminating the Moon
- Solar Eclipse: when the Earth passes through the Moon's shadow (the Sun disappears)
	- can happen only at new Moon (but not all new Moons)

### Eclipse Seasons
An eclipse requires Earth, Sun and Moon to all line up. It seems this would happen each full Moon (giving a lunar eclipse) and each new Moon (giving a solar eclipse), but the Moon's orbital plane is inclined by about 5 degree to the ecliptic, so at full or new Moon, the Moon is usually above or below the ecliptic (no eclipse).

We need the line of nodes (where the planes cross) to also line up with the Earth, Sun and Moon. The happens only twice each year -> two eclipse seasons per year. (normally about 6 months apart)

Eclipse prediction is complicated by the fact that the line of nodes precesses (rotates) with a period of ~ 18 years, so eclipse seasons occur ~ 20 days earlier each year.  
Combined with the 29.5 day lunar cycle, eclipses recur in a cycle of about 18 + 11.33 days (the saros cycle), but type (partial or total) and location are hard to predict.

Antikythera Mechanism (80BC) - Device that shows movements of planets and makes extremely accurate prediction of eclipses.

#### Precision
- The Earth spins like a top, causing bulging at the equator (and flattening at the poles)
- The Moon and Sun exert tidal forces on the bulge, that results in a net twisting force (torque)
- This torque causes the Earth's spin axis to slowly precess

Precession affects the orientation of a spinning object's axis, but not its tilt angle  

	spin period = 24 hr; precession period ~ 26,000 yr

This causes the equinoxes to precess, with period ~ 26,000 yr

#### Types of Year
- Sidereal Year
	- Time for Earth to complete one orbit relative to the stars
	- Time for Sun to move exactly once around the ecliptic
- Tropical Year
	- Time from one spring equinox to the next
	- about 20 minutes shorter because of precession of the equinoxes

	"If at this time we might presume to select the part of the Principia which probably astonishes and delighted and satisfied its readers more than any other, we should fix, without hesitation, on the explanation of the precession of the equinoxes" - Airy
