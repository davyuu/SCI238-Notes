## Overall Properties of Sun
- mass = 1.99 * 10^30 kg = 1 M_sun (about 1000 M_jup)
- radius = 6.96 * 10^8 (109 * R_earth) = 1 R_sun
- average denstiy = 1410 km/m^3
- compositive: 74% H, 25% He, 1% heavier elements
- luminosity = 3.9 * 10^26 Watt = 1 L_sun
- surface temp = 5800 K = T_eff
- rotation period = 25 days at equator but varies wit latitude and depth
- strong magnetic field

## What is the Sun
- ball of plazma
	- Ionized H & He -> 3 gasses in local thermal equilibrium
		- Positive ions, negative electrons, neutral protons
	- Plasma is oqaque
		- photons cant travel far before being scattered (absorbed/reemitted) by charged particles
- High temp, density , pressure at center
	- ~15 million K, 150 * water, 250 billion * P_atm
	- energy source is nuclear fusion -> kinetic energy of He nuclei & radiant energy of gamma rays
- Lower temp, density, pressure at surface
	- ~5800 K; density, pressure << Earth's atmosphere
	- Plasma becomes transparent at surface: hot blackbody

## Photosphere
- light sphere -> the apparent surface
- lowest and densest region of Sun's atmosphere
	- few hundred km thick
	- ~6000 K at bottom
	- ~4000K at top
- below photosphere, plasma is opaque to visible light
- features: granules (convection) & sunspots (maganetism)
- photosphere activity: fed by energy from interior and affects higher layers of Sun's atmosphere
- brighter at center of disk than at edge "limb darkening"
- center
	- can see deeper into hotter layers of photosphere
- edge
	- can see only shallower, cooler and less radiant layers
	- must look through more gas to reach hotter inner layers

## Granulation
granule: mottled appearnace of photosphere is evidence of thermal convection below surface
- Sun is boiling:
	- heated gas rises and radiates
	- cooled gas falls
- Granule diameter ~ 700-1200 km
- timeltime ~ 5-10 minutes

## Sunspots
regions of very strong magnetic field -> disrupts convection of hotter material from below -> cooler/darker

- concentrated magnetic field (B) lines should dissipate -> why do they persist?
- acoustic vibrations reveals:
	- "plug" of cooler material rushing downward & inward, pulling B lines together -> strong B field
	- String B field promotes furthur cooling -> self sustaining planet-sized whirlpool or hurricane

- sun rotates more rapidly at equator than at poles
- plasma at equator drags & twists magnetic field lines
- sunspots form where twisted lines break the surface

## Sunspot Cycle
- sunspot activity (fraction of visible surface they cover) varies with ~11 year cycles
- also migrate in latitude over same ~11 year cycle
- polarity of Sun's magnetic field flips with same ~11 year cycle -> ~22 year cycle from N-S to S-N to N-S again

## Origin of Sun's Magnetic Field
- Sun's magnetic field is dynamically induced and maintained
	- electrically conductive fluid (plasma)
	- internal energy (thermal) to drive convection
	- kinetic energy provided by solar rotation

## Solar Flares
- When twisted magnetic field lines "snap" and reconnect?
- Solar flares eject plasma into space ("coronal mass ejection")

## Chormosphere and Corona
- Chromosphere
	- transition region between photosphere and outer corona
	- less dense, thus less birght than photosphere
	- region of loops, prominences, flares
	- T increases from ~6000K at inner boundary to ~10^6 at outer boundary
- Corona
	- very low density, nearly a vacuum, faint
	- spectral lines of highly ionized elements -> T > 10^6

## Temperature
- lowest in photosphere
- highest in corona

## Chormosphere
- less dense (fainter) than photosphere
- can be seen in visible light during eclipse

__Solar wind__: a flow of charged particles from surface of Sun
__Corona__: Outermost layer of solar atmosphere ~1 million Κ
__Chromosphere__: Middle/transition layer of solar atmosphere ~ 6000-10^6 Κ
__Photosphere__: Visible surface of Sun ~6000 Κ
__Convection Zone__: Energy transported upward by rising hot plasma
__Radiation Zone__: Energy transported upward by photons
__Core__: Energy generated by nuclear fusion ~ 15 million Κ

Pressure-Gravity Balance
- pressure -> towards outside
- gravity -> towards inside
- __Downward__ force due to weight of column of plasma (due to gravity)
- is balanced by __net upward__ force due to __pressure gradient__
- Pressure pushes in all directions and increase with depth

Ideal Gas Law: P = nKT
n = # particles/volumne
	= number density

Star's M,R => P
Greater P => greater nT

T => KE (speed) of particles
n => probability of collisions
	-> both crucial for fusion

## Energy Balance
- rate at which energy radiates from surface of Sun must be same as the rate of which it is released by fusion in core

Rate of Energy Radiated from Surface:

	L = (4*pi*R^2) * σ*T^4

Sun:
	R ~= 7 * 10^8 m
	T ~= 5800 K
	=> L ~= 4 * 10^26 W

must be rate at which core is generating energy

Over lifetime of Sun (t ~= 5 billion years ~= 2 * 10^17 s)
- reps total energy output of: E_sun = Lt ~= 10^44 J

What could be source of energy?

## Energy Sources
Fire (Chemical)?

	Chemical Energy (J) / Luminosity (J/s) => ~10 thousand years

Contraction (Gravitational PE)?

	Gravitation Pot Energy (J) / Luminosity (J/s) => ~25 million years

H -> He Fusion (Nuclear)?

	Nuclear Pot Energy of Core (J) / Luminosity (J/s) => ~10 billion years

## Starting a Fusion Reaction
__Gravitation contraction__ of Solar Nebula
- provided energy that heated the core as the Sun was forming
	- up to critical T and n required for fusion
- contraction stopped after fusion began and fusion pressure gravity balance was established

## Fusion
- Fission
	- Big nucleus splits into smaller neclei
- Fusion
	- Small nuclei stick together to make a bigger one
	- High temps allow protons to move fast enough so that in head on colliions, they overcome mutual electrostatic repulsion and fuse via __strong nuclear force__
	- Sun releases energy by fusing four hydrogen nuclei into one helium nucleus
	- Mass of one He atom < mass of hour H atoms
		- Lost mass takes form of energy, via E = mc^2
	- Energy output is 0.7% of mass of original four hydrogen atoms

## Fusion via Proton-Proton Chain
Net IN: 4 H nuclei (protons)
Net OUT:
	- 1 He nucleus (alpha)
	- 2 gamma rays
	- 2 positrons (combine wit free electrons to make more gamma rays)
	- 2 neutrinos (which immediately leaves Sun)
	- Kinetic Energy

## Solar Thermostat
Fusion is very temperature sensitive:
- Decline in core temp -> decline in fusion rate -> core contracts & heats up
- Rise in core temp -> rise in fusion rate -> core expands & cools down

## Radiative Energy Transport
Fusion energy gradually leaks through radiation zone in form of gamma ray photons randomly bouncing off of electrons
	- eventually turning into X-ray photons

## Convection Energy Transport
This energy heats the bottom of the convection layer.
The resulting hot gas rises to the surface, radiating mainly visible-light termal photons into space

Math models predict centra T, density, particle fusion rate, netrino flux etc
	-> which agree wit all observations
desnity and temp strongly peaked at Sun's core

## Seismic Observations
- Patterns of vibration on surface (revealed by Doppler shifts)
- Data on solar vibrations agree wit math models of solar interior

## Neutrino Observations
- Neutrinos created during fusion fly directly throught Sun
- Math models predict precise rate of neutrino production
- Neutrinos can change flavour on way from Sun to Earth -> they have mass
