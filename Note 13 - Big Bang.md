# Big Bang
- evidence for hot big bang -> sky is dark at night
- assumptions
	- universe is infinitely big
	- stars evenly scattered
	- universe infinitely old
=> every line of sight would hit a star
=> at least one assumption wrong

- finite size or stars in finite region
	-> seems unlikely
- suggests universe had beginning - Big Bang

- far away stars dimmer?
- no: surface brightness is indep of distance

## Cosmic Horizon
- isntant before universe began: empty
- instant after: space is dark except near suface of stars
- Beginning:
	-> would see not an infinite but finite num of stars within cosmic horizon
	-> simple resolution of "Olbers' paradox" of dark night sky

## Evidence for Hot Big Bang

### Sky is dark at night
- additional assumptions:
	- stars all the way out
	- geometry of space is flat
	- universe is static
		- is expanding
		- causes dimming of distant objects due to redshift
		- effect on darkness is secondary
		- primary effect is due to finite age of universe

### Galactic redshift
- suggests galaxies are moving away
- recessional velocity ~ distance

Hubble Law: v = H_o * d
	where H_o = Hubble constant
			  = 70 +- 5 (km/s)/Mpc

- except for small peculiar velocites, galaxies dont move
	- space they are floating in expands
	- galaxies dont move
		- space expands
		- expansion has no center

Old Hubble Law [receding galaxies]: v = H_o * d
New Hubble Law [expanding space]: H = a^. / a
	where a(t) = scale factor of space
			   = size of space relative to present

   	eg.
   		past: 		a = 1/2
		present:	a = 1
		future:		a = 2

### CMBR
NB: All of sapce has always been uniformly filled wit matter
(since early universe, much gravitational clumping into stars & galaxies, on avg still uniform)

- we know present universe conditions & expansionrate
- running expansion backwards, can predict temp & density of universe at anytime in history using basic physics
	- tested to conditions 10^-10 sec after Big Bang
- early universe extremely hot and dense

- T > 3000K: ionized atoms (opaque universe)
- T < 3000K: neutral atoms (transparent universe)

- since recombination, thermal photons fill all space move freely through space (all directions)
- CMBR photons became free at ~380,000 yrs after BB
- as universe expands, thermal photons filling space become cooler and blackbody specturm becomes redder
- wavelength gets stretched as space expands -> redshift
- size of space has expanded by ~1100 since recombination
	- stretched wavelgnth of thermal photons by ~1100 to microwaves -> CMBR

### Element Abundances
- __Nucleosynthesis Era__: 0.001 sec < t < 3 min
- T > 10^11 K: n->p+e and p+e->n happen equally
	- p and n abundances equal
- T < 10^11 K: p+e->n no longer happens (but n->p+e can)
	- p starts to outnumber n
- T < 10^10 K: fusion products no longer broken up
	- helium, deuterium, lithium remain stable
- at ~1 minute, BB predicts 7-to-1 p:n ratio
	- implies: 75% H, 25% He (by mass)
	- matches observations of primordial gases
- BB produced trace amounts of other light elements
- measrued deuterium/hydrogen ratio + BB model predict density of ordinary matter in universe
	- ~4.6% critical density
- at ~3 minutes (T < 10^9 K) fusion stops

## Sumary
- Dark Night Sky -> Universe had beginning
- Galactic Redshift -> Beginning was dense
- Cosmic Background Radiation (BB) -> Beginning was hot
- Abundances of Primordial Elements -> Details right

## Early Universe Cosmology
- early Universe filled wit hot matter (subatomic particles) and radiation (photons)
- alchemy of Einstein's E=mc^2 was continuously converting:
	- matter -> radiation
	- radiation -> matter

- 4 known interactions (forces) in universe
	- Strong force
	- Electromagnetism
	- Weak force
	- Gravity
- these forces are thought to unify at high enough tmeps

## Planck Era (t < 10^-43 sec)
- most important era, almost nothing known
- need theroy of quantum gravity that unifies
	- quantum mechanics
	- general relativity
- suppose all 4 forces unified during this era into superforce

## GUT Era (10^-43 < t < 10^-38 sec)
- universe contained two natural forces
	- gravity
	- Grand Unified Theroy (GUT) force = unified electromagnetic + weak + strong
- lasted til 10^-38 sec
	- cooled to 10^29 K
	- strong force froze out of GUT force
	- energy (latent heat) released by phase change caused sudden dramatic inflation of size of universe

## Electroweak Era (10^-38 < t < 10^-10 sec)
- universe contained three natural forces
	- gravity
	- strong
	- electroweak
- lasted til 10^-10 sec
	- cooled to 10^15 K
	- electromagnetic and weak forces separated
- experimentally verified
	- electroweak particles predicted to exist above 10^15 K
	- discovery of W and Z

## Particle Era (10^-10 < t < 0.001 sec)
- all four natural forces
- when 10^-4 old
	- quarks combined
		- protons, neutrons, antimatter versions
		- equal creation and annihilation
			- radioation (photons)
			<- -> matter and antimatter
- at 10^-3 sec old
	- cooled to 10^12 K
	- photons not energetic enoguh for creation
	- all matter and antimatter (proton and neutron) -> radiation
	- slight imbalance between num of matter and antimatter particles allowed some matter to remain
- Electrons and positirons still interchaning wit photons

## Era of Nucleosynthesis (0.001 sec < t < 3 min)
- at beginnning
	- proton and neutron started fusing
	- new nuclei torn apart by high energy photons
- when 3 mins old
	- cooled to 10^9 K
	- fusion stopped, nuclei not torn apart
- baryonic matter created in Big Band
	- 75% hydrogen nuclei (protons)
	- 25% helium nuclei (alpha particles)
	- trace amounts of deuterium and lithium nuclei

## Era of Nuclei (3 min < t < 380,000 yrs)
- universe was hot plasma of H and He nuclei + electrons
	- photons couldnt travel far before being scattered by electron
	- universe opaque
- when 380,000 yrs old
	- cooled to 3000 K
	- electrons combined wit nuclei -> stable H and He atoms
	- universe became transparent
	- photons were free to stream across universe
		- later became CMBR

## Era of atoms (380,000 yrs < t < 10^9 yrs)
- filled with atomic gas < 3000 K
	- refered as Cosmic Dark Ages
- gravitational attraction enhaves slight density fluctuations (in gas and dark matter)
	- protogalactic clouds
	- first light of stars
	- first galaxies

## Era of Galaxies (t > 10^9 yr)
- first galaxies cmae ~1 billion yrs after BB
- current era

# Sumamry
- early universe so hot and dense that radiation constantly producing particles-antiparticle pairs and vise versa
	- matter-antimatter balance + photons
- as universe cooled, particle-antiparticle production stopped
	- massive annihilation wit leftover small amount of matter
	- initially radiation-dominated
- fusion captured remaining neutrons into helium
- radiation traveled freely after formation of neutral atoms

## Problems wit BB model
1) why overall distribution of matter so uniform?
2) where does structure come from (slight non-uniformity)?
3) why total mass-energy density of uniserve so close to critical density (for flat space)?

## Cosmic Inflation
- when strong froze out of GUT force
	- latent heat released had enough energy to expand universe by >10^26 times in less than 10^-32 sec
	- and fill universe wit all elementary particles
- dramatic expansion called inflation
- inflation stretches tiny quantum ripples to enomous size
	-> 1:100,00 temp/density fluctuations in CMBR
- these ripples in density become seeds for gravitational collapse -> all structures in universe

- we come from stardust
- we come from random quantum fluctuations that expanded to cosmic size during inflation

- how CMBR temp be nearly identical on opposite sides of sky?
	- two clouds could not have commed in 380,000 yrs since BB
	- regions now on opp sides of sky were close together
		- could come to thermal equilibirum
	- before inflation pushed far apart

- flat (critical) geometry: density = critical
- spherical (closed) geometry: density > critical
- saddle-shaped (open) geometry: density < critical

Einstein: overall geometry of observable universe closely related to total density of matter and energy filling space
Observations of CMBR -> overall geometry of observable universe is ~= flat -> density ~= critical

__Critical density__ -> gravitational pull of stuff in universe balances kinetic energy of expansion
	V_galaxies = V_escape
__Problem__: requires mysterious __fine tuning__
- universe that starts perfectly flat, stays perfectly flat
- universe that stars out only slightly non-flat quickly diverges from flatness
__Solution__: inflation of universe flattens overall geomtry like inflation of ballon (to extremely flat)
	causing overall density of matter + energy tobe very close to critical density

# Summary
__CMBR__ -> overall geometry ~ flat -> mass-energy density ~ critical
__Nucleosynthesis__ -> atoms ~ 4% -> 96% not atoms (non-baryonic)

Dark matter ~23%
Dark energy ~73%

Age is 13.7 billion years
